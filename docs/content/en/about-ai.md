# About AI Tools

Based on the code organization adopted in this project, each type such as `domain model`, `command handler`, `event handler`, etc., has clear responsibilities and capabilities. This is very friendly for the auxiliary use of AI tools. AI tools can accurately infer intentions and provide code completion suggestions based on the file model and context of the code you write. As your project code increases, the intelligence of AI tools will become higher.

Therefore, it is highly recommended to use AI tools to assist in writing code, as this can greatly improve coding efficiency.

The following tips can help AI tools better assist you in writing code:

+ Use type names with business meanings
+ Use method names with clear functional meanings
+ Appropriate comments
